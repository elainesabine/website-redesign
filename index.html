                            <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
                            <p>Hi! My name is Elaine and I am currently a second year computer science student at Cal Poly SLO. My main technical focus is front-end web development, aspiring to be a full-stack web developer. My other areas of interest include artificial intelligence, and virtual reality. </p>
                
                            <p>After discovering my passion for web development, I decided to start participating in hackathons to collaborate with other students to use technology to tackle social issues. So far this year, I have developed several web apps intended to improve the lives of people in our community, such as increasing safety of students living on campus, and helping families with children who have autism. </p>
                            
                            <p>Asides from web development, I am also highly involved in the women in technology community at Cal Poly through clubs such as Women Involved in Software and Hardware, and Society of Women Engineers. </p>
                
                            <p>My side passions include photography, video editing, desigining, and making piano covers. </p>
                            
                            <p>Feel free to email me for a copy of my resume!</p>

                        <p>- Caption This is a website application that aids hearing impaired students in understanding course materials.</p>
                        <p>- This web app allows students to upload videos recorded during lectures and add closed captions to the uploaded videos, which hearing impaired students can then use as a resource.</p>
                        <p>-For this project, I used HTML, CSS and AngularJS to create the user interface. This was my first time working with Angular so it was a little challenging. However, I was able to solve most of my problems within the 24 hour time limit, and I definitely learnt a lot. </p>

                        <p>- GoPolySafe is a location based web application that integrates safety, communication, and gives students a peace of mind around their campus community.</p>
                        <p>- Students are able to report incidents and view reported incidents on a map. Law enforcement or University Police are able to log into a more detailed dashboard of non-emergency reports and respond appropriately. This enables immediate communication between UPD and students regarding active incidents. </p>
                        <p>- For this project I assisted with the front-end development using Bootstrap to create a responsive UI.</p>
